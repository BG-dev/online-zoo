                            There are two species of gorilla, each containing 
                            two subspecies. The two species are eastern and 
                            western, and the four sub-species are <span>Cross River</span> 
                            and <span>Western</span> Lowland (are sub-species of the Western 
                            species) and Grauer’s and Mountain (are sub-species 
                            of the Eastern species). Western gorillas can be 
                            distinguished from other gorilla <span>subspecies</span> by their 
                            brownish-gray hair, auburn-colored crests and overall 
                            smaller size. Eastern gorillas tend to be black in 
                            color and larger in size. In all gorillas, males develop 
                            silver coloration along their backs as they mature. 
                            The species is diurnal, which means they are active 
                            during the day, and of all the great apes, gorillas 
                            are the most terrestrial. This means that they 
                            primarily live on the ground, although they do 
                            <span>occasionally climb trees</span> to feed and nest. They 
                            are also able to stand on two legs for short 
                            periods of time.

                            Gorillas are the largest of all primates and reach 
                            physical maturity between 12 and 15 years of age. 
                            Males can be between 350 and 450 pounds, almost 
                            twice as much as females, weighing in between 
                            <span>150</span> and <span>250</span> pounds. Males stand between 5.5 to 
                            6 feet tall. Females are a bit smaller, standing 
                            between 4’7” to 4’11”. The males’ heads are large 
                            and pointed due to the sagittal crest that forms 
                            the back of the top of the head. This crest serves 
                            as the foundation for attachment of a great number 
                            of jaw muscle fibers, which allows for the chewing 
                            power needed to process tough vegetation. <br> <br>

                            The vision and perception of western lowland gorillas 
                            is similar to that of humans. Gorillas have a prominent 
                            brow ridge, small, flat ears, and hear about the same 
                            as humans. The nose is broad, flat and fleshy. The 
                            wrinkles on a gorilla’s nose, known as a noseprint, 
                            are like human fingerprints, and every individual’s 
                            noseprint is unique. Researchers use these noseprints 
                            as identification markers in their studies, both in 
                            zoological settings and in the wild. <br> <br>

                            Gorillas have 32 teeth, including sharp canines used 
                            for defense and breaking through vegetation. Their 
                            molars have complicated patterns of cups and ridges 
                            that facilitate chewing of tough plant fibers. <br> <br>

                            Gorillas’ faces, hands, and feet are bare, but the rest 
                            of their bodies are covered with short, thin hair. 
                            Gorilla hands and feet are large, with leathery 
                            palms and soles, and broad, flat nails Their hands 
                            are very dexterous and can pick up small, delicate 
                            objects. Like their hands, their feet have opposable 
                            thumbs and toes. Like all apes, gorillas’ arms are 
                            longer than their legs—a feature that allows them to 
                            walk on all fours. They are called “knuckle-walkers,”
                            meaning that they walk on the knuckles of their forelimbs 
                            and the soles of their hind limbs. This form of locomotion 
                            develops calluses on the knuckles, preserving the 
                            sensitivity of the fingertips necessary for 
                            <span>manipulating</span> smaller objects.

                            Gorillas tend to be shy, peaceful creatures; they 
                            are not normally aggressive to other animals unless 
                            provoked. However, if they are provoked, they can 
                            be dangerous. They can demonstrate aggression by 
                            charging towards perceived intruders. Typically, 
                            they will not actually hit the intruder, but rush 
                            past, turn and then charge again. <br> <br>

                            Gorillas use a combination of vocalizations, visual signals 
                            and scents to communicate. They are considered relatively 
                            quiet compared to other primates, but do have at least <span>25 
                            recognized</span> vocalizations, including: <br>
                            • Hooting: Can carry for a mile through the forest and is 
                            usually accompanied by display behavior such as chest 
                            beating, strutting, and vegetation slapping <br>
                            • Screams: Sounds of alarm or warning <br>
                            • Belches: Deep rumblings of contentment, comfort, or 
                            well-being <br>
                            • Sharp Grunts: Used when discipline is required <br>
                            • Whoop Barks: High-pitched barks denote curiosity <br>
                            • Bark Grunt: Aggression <br>
                            • Chuckles: Playfulness <br> <br>

                            Infants have three distinct vocalizations; these are 
                            similar to the cries of a human baby. They will 
                            typically cry when hurt or frightened, resulting 
                            in an immediate response from the mother. <br> <br>

                            Dominant males also have a distinctive smell that they 
                            use to communicate with other troops and to maintain 
                            contact with their own troop. Perhaps the most 
                            recognizable behavior performed by gorillas is 
                            chest-beating. It is primarily done by male gorillas 
                            at the end of a display meant to intimidate intruding 
                            males or predators. The sound can be heard for long 
                            distances. Females will chest-beat infrequently; they 
                            will typically beat their hands against the insides of 
                            their thighs. Chest-beating can also indicate playful 
                            behavior, however, especially in the young. Young 
                            gorillas play much like humans do, playing tag and 
                            doing somersaults. <br> <br>

                            Western lowland gorillas live in family groups known 
                            as troops. These troops can consist of 5 to 30 
                            individuals, although the average size is 11. The 
                            group is led by a dominant silverback male and 
                            contains several adult females and their young. The 
                            females will typically bond with the silverback, but 
                            not necessarily with each other. The silverback will 
                            remain dominant for as long as he can 
                            defeat competing males. <br> <br>

                            There are several younger, blackback males that remain 
                            in the group until they are capable of challenging the 
                            silverback. These young males are often driven out of 
                            the troop to live a solitary life or to live in a 
                            smaller group with other bachelors until they 
                            establish their own troops. If a dominant silverback 
                            is displaced, the new dominant male will typically 
                            kill the infants in the troop, sending the females 
                            prematurely into reproductive cycling. This 
                            increases the male’s chances of siring offspring, 
                            as his time as the dominant male is uncertain. As 
                            such, females consider a male’s ability to fight 
                            paramount to their offspring’s survival. <br> <br>

                            On maturing, females will also leave their natal 
                            group to join a lone male or another small group. 
                            This is vital to prevent inbreeding and to protect 
                            the gene pool. <br> <br>

                            Nesting typically occurs in the late afternoon, 
                            with the gorillas bedding down for the night at 
                            sundown. The females and their offspring will 
                            build nests of leaves and branches, while the 
                            dominant silverback will settle at the base of 
                            the tree, in order to protect his family. At 
                            Zoo Atlanta, while the gorillas are outside, 
                            their indoor areas are thoroughly cleaned; the 
                            walls and floors are scrubbed with <span>disinfectant</span>. 
                            The gorillas are offered hay in their indoor area 
                            at night and nest with this material, replicating 
                            natural behavior. <br> <br>

                            In a troop, the single silverback male will mate 
                            with the females, siring all the offspring of the 
                            troop. Females generally reach reproductive maturity 
                            between 7 and 8 years of age, with males reaching 
                            maturity later, around 10 years of age, due to 
                            competition. The potential breeding season is 
                            year-round and gestation typically takes 256 days, 
                            or about 8.5 months. Labor can last anywhere from 
                            one to 4 hours. Babies are usually born singly; 
                            twins are rare. Newborns weigh between 3 and 5 pounds 
                            and are weaned around 2 to 3 years of age, but can 
                            be dependent on their mothers for up to 4 years. 
                            The average interval between births for a female 
                            gorilla is four to six years.

                            Western lowland gorillas prefer the tall, lush 
                            tropical forest of west and central Africa. 
                            The herbs, shrubs and vines that make up its 
                            diet grow best where the open canopy allows 
                            plenty of light to reach the forest floor. These 
                            tropical forests also contain a much higher 
                            diversity of arboreal substrates and foods, in 
                            particular fruit, than mountainous habitats. 
                            Western lowland gorillas live primarily on the 
                            ground and build sleeping nests on the ground 
                            or in the trees for the night.

                            Western lowland gorillas are primarily herbivorous, 
                            feeding on plant parts including seeds, leaves, stems, 
                            shoots, roots and flowers; however, they prefer fruit 
                            whenever it’s in season. Occasionally they will eat 
                            insects, such as termites or ants, as a supplement 
                            to their diet when they are readily available. Due 
                            to their dietary preferences, western lowland 
                            gorillas spend a lot of their time in and around 
                            trees, especially fruit trees. Even large males 
                            can sometimes be found up in the trees, but they 
                            are careful to stay near a main trunk or on 
                            larger branches that are able to support 
                            their weight. Younger, lighter gorillas may 
                            climb higher in trees, even swinging freely 
                            from branch to branch. Gorillas never completely 
                            strip vegetation from a single area; rather, 
                            the rapid regrowth of the vegetation they 
                            consume allows them to stay within a reasonable 
                            confined home range for extended periods of time. <br> <br>

                            Here at Zoo, we provide a medley of fruits and 
                            vegetables to our western lowland gorillas. 
                            These include apples, oranges, bananas, raisins, 
                            sweet potatoes, cabbage, collards, and primate 
                            chow. In the morning, vegetables and fruit are 
                            chopped up and <span>scattered</span> around the habitat. 
                            From there, the gorillas come outside and forage 
                            for their food as they would in the wild. Browse 
                            foods including bamboo, banana leaves, mulberry, 
                            elm and willow are also scattered in their habitat.
